# VR-Based Guided Exercise System for Individuals with Locomotor Disabilities 🥽

This repository showcases a Virtual Reality (VR) application specifically designed to assist individuals with locomotor disabilities in performing guided physical exercises via VR devices. Developed with a focus on Oculus products, the project was created in collaboration with certified physicians from the School of Physiology at DY Patil University, offering a truly immersive experience that adapts therapeutic exercises to meet the needs of users with limited mobility.

## Project Overview 📘

The **VR-Based Guided Exercise System** was initially built as part of a research initiative aimed at making therapeutic exercises more accessible, engaging, and efficient. Exercise routines were carefully designed and approved by healthcare professionals, ensuring their safety and therapeutic effectiveness.

Following successful testing and validation, the School of Physiology adopted the project for real-world application. The system is currently utilized with selected patients in hospital settings and serves as an educational resource for students conducting thesis research in physical therapy and VR applications. Due to patient privacy considerations and the proprietary advancements of the institution, the full project code and files remain private.

## Available Resources 🗂️

While the primary project files are not publicly accessible, this repository includes an APK file offering a demo of the VR-based exercise application. This APK allows users to experience core functionalities of the application, demonstrating the potential of VR in guided therapeutic exercise.

This application has been tested extensively on VR devices like the Meta Quest 2 and Quest Pro to ensure optimal performance and a seamless user experience.
